# About The Project
This is a learning project created under CodeCool for testing the website of Aegir with automated testing. The System Under Testing is included below. \
The SUT is found here : https://github.com/CodecoolGlobal/system-under-testing-registration-form-general-Zergi0 \
This is a practice project made with the intention of learning how to handle more complex and flawed forms in Selenium. \
Since the information required for each test is massive, the project uses Parameterized tests as a way to help readability.
